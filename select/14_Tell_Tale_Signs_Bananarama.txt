Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies

You keep saying to me time and time again
You'd be true to me if I don't see other men
When you didn't even come home, again last night
It only took one call to prove me right

Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies

Don't you remember when you always said to me
Honesty, that is the only way it should be
But if you turn your back on a promise okay
I can do tonight, what you did yesterday

Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies

Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies

Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
Tell tale
Tell tale signs
Still you keep telling me
Those little white lies
