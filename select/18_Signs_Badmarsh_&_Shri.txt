Life is one big road, road.
And we'vea lots of signs, signs and more signs.
Ya gotta make up ya mind...
To face reality all the time, know.
Many a' sorrow, many a' joy. (Whe)never ya try to take life for a toy.
Some doing good an' some doin' bad.
But 'least I feel bad 'cause was drivin' me mad.
But when the sun shines today I go on my knees and I pray.
I say "
Looord, Lemme have joy." I say "
Lord, Let me have joy.
Never let me have no sorrows."...
Oh no no no no no.
