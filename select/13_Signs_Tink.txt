Ooohh
Signs

A dove has no aim, thrown off my game, we were supposed to
Last for a while, walk down that aisle, just to say hi to
Your the picture perfect boy
I kept it ten times ten, than against my own friends
I must been outta my mind, why didn't I peep all the signs, signs

You lie to me like a Scorpio, stubborn as an Aries
Confused like a Capricorn and that's the reason that I'm also torn
Your bad for me like a Cancer, selfish like a Taurus
My mind's telling me to leave tonight
But you fuck me good just like a Gemini, oh

Body won't let me see, how bad you are for me
I see things now, see clearly how
I'm seeing the signs, I'm seeing the signs
Had me fooled from the start, you didn't want my heart
I see things now, so clearly how
I'm seeing the signs, I see the signs, the signs
Peepin' the signs, peepin' the signs
Peepin' the signs, peepin' the signs

I knew what you were, you were twisting your words
Say you love me, say you love me
I'm not sure you do, it's too much to lose
Whoever cannot get right get left in the dust
And I gotta dead it tonight, I'ma be tough

You lie to me like a Scorpio, stubborn as an Aries
Confused like a Capricorn and that's the reason that I'm also torn
Your bad for me like a Cancer, selfish like a Taurus
My mind's telling me to leave
Tonight but you fuck me good like a Gemini

Body won't let me see, how bad you are for me
I see things now, so clearly how
I'm seeing the signs, I'm seeing the signs
Had me fooled from the start, you didn't want my heart
I see things now, so clearly how
I'm seeing the signs, I see the signs
Peepin' the signs, peepin' the signs
Peepin' the signs, peepin' the signs

Every time I call I can't get an answer
Taking everything I gave you for granted
You only come around when you need
Something, I'm peepin' the signs, I'm peepin' the signs
If he tellin' you one thing and showin' another then (runaway)
If he never got time to be bothered wit you (runaway)
If he can't return your love (runaway)
You see the signs, you see the signs
