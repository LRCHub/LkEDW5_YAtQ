I’ve never felt like this before
Begging while you walk out the door
I don’t know what this love’s even for
Mmm ~
Don’t give a damn about me now
You made it clear but somehow
I wake up right next to you
Your eyes, sweet and smooth like honey
Only love me for my body, body
When the lights are down nice and  low
And boy I’m sad sometimes
Tears makin’ it blurry
To see the way out falling I might drown
We’re going up & down
(Crying, can’t see a damn thing)
All around
(Made a nightmare, killed a daydream)
Now
My eyes can’t -

See the truth, I cling onto you
Cause I love your -

Those pretty words that just make me high
My friends say I can’t see the

No I can’t see the -
Ah yeah

Oh woah
Hey
It’s like a poison, corruption
And I just keep letting you in
Love’s just a game in the end
(To you)
Thought love’s meant to open doors to something
incredible
(I’d rather be dead than feel this again)
Your touch, like a carnivor,
It's eating me up
Boy, what’s to gain?
We’re going up & down
(Crying, can’t see a damn thing)
All around
(Made a nightmare, killed a daydream)
Now
My eyes can’t -

See the truth, I cling onto you

Don’t care about my tears
The hurt you make me feel
Oh
I’m disappearing
Begging you
Turn my way
You tell pretty -
Lies
